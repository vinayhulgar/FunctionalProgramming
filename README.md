# :green_book: What is Functional Programming:<br />

  :chocolate_bar: Every software program has two things:<br />

   :pushpin: Behavior (what the program does)<br />
   :pushpin: Data (data, is well, data)<br />
   :pushpin: When we’re learning about a programming paradigm — like functional programming — it’s often helpful to consider how the   paradigm approaches behavior and data respectively.<br />

  :chocolate_bar: Behavior, in functional programming, is handled purely using functions in functional programming. Functions are “self contained” pieces of code that accomplish a specific task. They define a relationship between a set of possible inputs and a set of possible outputs — they usually take in data, process it, and return a result. Once a function is written, it can be used over and over and over again.<br />

  :chocolate_bar: Data, in functional programming, is immutable — meaning it can’t be changed. Rather than changing data they take in, functions in functional programming take in data as input and produce new values as output. Always.<br />

:chocolate_bar: Functions and immutable data are the only two things you need to ever deal with in functional programming. To make it even simpler, functions are treated no differently than data.<br />

:chocolate_bar: Put another way, functions in functional programming can be passed around as easily as data. You can refer to them from constants and variables, pass them as parameters to other functions, and return them as results from other functions.<br />

:chocolate_bar: This is the most important thing to understand when approaching functional programming.<br />
